# [DESIGN THINKING](https://designthinking.ideo.com)
Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.

## Phase 1: Empathize

Empathy provides the critical starting point for Design Thinking. The first stage of the process is spent getting to know the user and understanding their wants, needs and objectives.

## Phase 2: Define

The second stage in the Design Thinking process is dedicated to defining the problem. We gather all of  findings from the empathise phase and start to make sense of them.

## Phase 3: Ideate

The third phase in the Design Thinking process is where the creativity happens, and it’s crucial to point out that the ideation stage is a judgement-free zone. We will hold ideation sessions in order to come up with as many new angles and ideas as possible.

## Phase 4: Prototype

A prototype is basically a scaled-down version of the product which incorporates the potential solutions identified in the previous stages. This step is key in putting each solution to the test and highlighting any constraints and flaws.

## Phase 5: Test

The results of the testing phase will often lead  back to a previous step, providing the insights  need to redefine the original problem statement or to come up with new ideas hadn’t thought of before.

# In conclusion
Design Thinking is a solution-based approach to exploring and solving problems. It focuses on generating ideas with a specific problem in mind, keeping the user at the heart of the process throughout. Once you’ve established and designed a suitable solution.
