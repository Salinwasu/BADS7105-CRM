#  [The Apriori algorithm](https://medium.com/edureka/apriori-algorithm-d7cc648d4f1e)
Apriori algorithm is a sequence of steps to be followed to find the most frequent itemset in the given database

Antecedent (IF): This is an item/group of items that are typically found in the Itemsets or Datasets.\
Consequent (THEN): This comes along as an item with an Antecedent/group of Antecedents.

### Definition of Lift Value
Lift : Lift indicates the strength of a rule over the random occurrence of A and B. It basically tells us the strength of any rule.
### Definition of Support Value
Support : It gives the fraction of transactions which contains item A and B. Basically Support tells us about the frequently bought items or the combination of items bought frequently.
### Definition of Confidence Value
Confidence : It tells us how often the items A and B occur together, given the number times A occurs.

# Final Association Rules
* Set antecedents = 1
* Set consequents = 1
* Set  lift >= 1
* Set support >= 0.6
* Set confidence >= 0.7

# [Collaborative Filtering - Cosine similarity algorithm](https://medium.com/@toprak.mhmt/collaborative-filtering-3ceb89080ade)
Collaborative filtering is based on the fact that relationships exist between products and peopleâ€™s interests. Many recommendation systems use collaborative filtering to find these relationships and to give an accurate recommendation of a product that the user might like or be interested in.

* Use users' ratings for each item as its feature vector, calculates cosine similarity values for each pair of items. We could recommend items based on item similarity.
